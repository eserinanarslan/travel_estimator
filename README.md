# travel_estimator
Estimate travel duration

This project is prepared to predict the travel time.

You can execute jupyter notebook on your local machine  or google.colab but probably grid search operations take too much time so you need to high computational power.

There is a bug on google colab, sometimes whne you want to upload your data file, it takes error. In these times, you have to execute twice.

travel_time_estimation.ipynb notebook is prepared for preprocess and your machine learning model.

analysis.ipynb is also created for analysis.
